                   <h1>What makes <i>you</i> so qualified&#44; Michael Carter&#63;</h1>
                <p>In order to establish a few last words on the VT-Shaped Student&#44; I need to take a good look at myself and my interests to decide what makes me qualified for analysis.</p>
                <h2>Let&#39;s Look at Wine</h2>
                <p>Wine &#40;as a general topic&#41; is the focus of my Podcast project. It is also one of my most &ldquo;T-Shaped&rdquo; interests. I love both drinking it, and selling it. Sure, you might be thinking what any normal adult would think when hearing that a college student is interested in wine. It&#39;s just a tool for inebriation, right&#63; Wrong&#33; Wine is an industry, science, academic field, exercise in honing senses, and many more great things. I <i>hate</i> to drink it in excess, and it is best appreciated in small increments.</p>
                <p>Virginia Tech offers a class on wine with up to 1000 students per semester offered. Why offer a class on wine&#63; Because it is &ldquo;T-Shaped.&rdquo; I go in to more detail here in my podcast, but simply put, this Virginia Tech elective course provided me with an introduction to a field that I could potentially have a <em>career</em> in. Not just a job, but a career. Isn&#39;t that the point of college&#63;</p>
                <p>So even though <i>my</i> degree isn&#39;t in Viticulture or Viniculture, my education has lead me to a new interest and a potential career. This is what the &ldquo;VT-Shaped Student&rdquo; is all about, but I didn&#39;t know that until about a month ago, when I started ENGL 3844. </p>
                <h2>Am I Write&#63;</h2>
                <p>I am happy to write that working through the English program at Virginia Tech has made me a better writer than ever before. Again, college doing it&#39;s job. But if you tell someone that you are a &ldquo;writer&rdquo; you are bound to get some funny looks and doubtful expectations. I&#39;ve found that we, as English students, need to broaden our definition of &ldquo;writing.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Writing today exists in more diverse fashions than ever before, many of which we covered in this course. Podcasting is a type of writing. Webbuilding is writing. Anytime you create or post content to social media or digital means it is recorded, and therefore in a sense &ldquo;written.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>So when I say that today I am a better &ldquo;writer&rdquo; than I have ever been, I mean that in a number of ways. When I&#39;m working through a course or communicating with other students or professors, I feel like I&#39;m practicing writing. Whether this involves pen, paper, typewriter, computer screen, or none of the above, writing is all around us.</p>
                <p>So I&#39;ve made it through college and I am a better writer. What do I do with that now&#63; These are the things I&#39;ve thought about in forming my podcast and final project.</p>
                <h2>Maybe I&#39;m Not the Super Student I Thought I was...</h2>
                <p>Like I stated in the introduction, the first half of this website was particularly focused on my detachment from the VT-Shaped Student Concept. But I&#39;ve done some thinking recently...and I&#39;m soon to be a graduate. It&#39;s nearly time to start from square one, with less help than ever before. On my own in the so-called &ldquo;real world.&rdquo; Good for me for making it through school and recieving grades, but what next&#63;</p>
                <p>It&#39;s going to be time to apply my learning&#33; I feel that this get&#39;s lost on my generation&#33; Yes, many of us came to this university to recieve a diploma with our name on it, but applying our learning towards our &ldquo;next steps&rdquo; is just as important. It can be easy to get lost out there.</p>
                <p>So I think that this is an important area where being &ldquo;VT-Shaped&rdquo; could come in handy. What does being a well-rounded student mean for graduates&#63;</p>
