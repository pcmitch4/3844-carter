                    <img src="totz-copy.jpg" />
                    <h6>That sure <i>looks</i> like a VT-Shaped student, though.</h6>
                    <p>I don&#39;t have a problem with the VT-Shaped Student initiative. I understand the purpose of recruiting and building the university. But the VT-Shaped Student initiative isn&#39;t built for me and doesn&#39;t include me. Here are some reasons why. </p>
                    
                    <h3>How do <b>I</b> fit here&#63;</h3>
                    
                    <p>Not to toot my own horn, but I&#39;m a pretty well rounded individual.</p>
                    <ul><li>I&#39;m committed to learning within my major. My grades are good. I interact with my professors and try to make my own work reflect well on my program. </li>
                    <li>I have enjoyed courses outside of my major and related them to my own studies, personal and work lives.</li>
                    <li>Building this website is an example of how I&#39;m using technology to enhance my learning. English majors didn&#39;t do things like this in the past&#33;</li>
                    <li>I even did an English department internship with Montgomery County Public Schools.</li></ul>
                    <p>Sounds like I can check off my VT-Shaped checklist. But here&#39;s the thing, and this is why I consider myself an Anti VT-Shaped Student&#58;<strong> anything I&#39;ve done at Virginia Tech to build myself as a good student and person has been intuitive or brought on naturally from my course of study.</strong> I didn&#39;t even <strong>know</strong> about the VT-Shaped Student until I started this class two weeks ago&#33; My interests and developments aren&#39;t based in the person the University wants me to be, but in the person I want to build myself in to.</p>
