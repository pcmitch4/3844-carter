                    <h6>Michael Carter&#58; Student, Blacksburgian, Friend</h6>
                    <p>My name is Michael Carter and I am a rising senior at Virginia Tech. I am originally from Blacksburg and loved the place enough to stick around and get a degree here. </p>

             <h3>Academically Adequate</h3>
                <p>I graduated from Blacksburg High School in 2014 with a solid grade point average and a decent head on my shoulders. I knew I wanted to go to college, but I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do. Virginia Tech was a great choice with an array of majors I could choose from. Plus, I knew Blacksburg and I knew campus&#59; therefore I knew I would like it here. </p>
                <p>At the end of freshman year I decided that I would pursue a degree in English. I still didn't have a clear plan as to what I wanted out of my education, or what kind of career I wanted to pursue, but I knew that I loved reading and writing. I always have. Right around when I declared my major, things were changing within the English department. I chose three brand new, reformed concentrations&#58; Pre-Education, Literature, and Creative Writing.</p>
                <p>Today, I&#39;m happy with my academic choices. My grades have been good and I&#39;m hoping &#40;and working hard towards&#41; graduating with Summa Cum Laude distinction. Last semester I entered a paper in the Phi Beta Kappa Wilson Essay Contest and won&#33; I was honored that my writing had been appreciated and thankful for my professors that helped me become the writer that I am today. </p>
                
                <h3>Almost Athletic</h3>
                <img src=running.png>
                <h6>Me and some college friends sporting my Blacksburg jersey collection from throughout the years</h6>
                <p>From ages twelve to nineteen I was running competitively in Cross Country and Track. Running was the first sport that I enjoyed real success in. I was part of a few state championship teams in track and a 4x8 relay team that took two second-place finishes in the National High School meet. &#40;We lost by slim margins&#59; painful, but you can&#39;t complain too much with second place in the nation&#33;&#41;. </p>
                <p>I was able to walk on to the track team at Virginia Tech, and participated for the entirety of my freshman year. It was hard work and I really did love every minute of it, but I didn&#39;t enjoy the same success that I did in high school. I packed up my running shoes at the beginning of my sophomore year and put more focus in to work and school. I miss running a lot and often wish I could have contributed to the University as an athlete, but it was the right decision for me to put more stock in to other things.</p>
                
                <h3><i>That I May Service Industry</i></h3>
                <p>Something that I take great pride in is my work outside of the classroom. When I started college I figured that I could spend my weekends doing one of two things&#58; getting in to trouble, or making money. Thankfully for my sense of self &#40;and the greater Blacksburg community&#41; I chose the latter. I got a job at Souvlaki in downtown Blacksburg and have worked there ever since. </p>

                <h6>A selection of the Souvlaki family</h6>
                <p>Working at Souvlaki has taught me things that you can&#39;t learn in the classroom. Thanks to this job, I&#39;m a better communicator and problem-solver. I understand more how to be practical and hard-working in real-life contexts, rather than practicing for the future the way school has taught me. </p>
                <p>My job at Souvlaki has also primed me for my new job that I started this summer at Beliveau Estate Winery, where I operate wine tastings. I&#39;m learning more about wine every day&#59; a super complex beverage and industry. Maybe I have a future in it&#63;</p>
