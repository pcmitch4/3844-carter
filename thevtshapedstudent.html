                    <img src="provost-vtstudent.jpg" />
                    <h6>This fancy powerpoint slide summarizes the provost&#39;s VT-Shaped Student initiative</h6>
                    <p>The VT-Shaped Student initiative was created by Virginia Tech's new provost, Thanassis Rikakis, in the hopes of moving the University in a more 21st century direction. The initiative involves an expansion of the <a href=http://undergraduate.provost.vt.edu/vt-shaped-student.html>&ldquo;T-shaped Individual&rdquo;</a> in creating a relationship between the University, the individual, and cross-disciplinary learning in a technologically enhanced setting. Sounds fancy right&#63;</p>

                    <p>Well, let&#39;s break this down. Here&#39;s my breakdown of the VT-Shaped individual.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h5>The Vertical Component</h5>
                            <p>This is the primary foundation of your education. Basically, your major. The initiative stresses growing strengths of individual departments in making the university nationally acclaimed and recognized.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            <h5>The Horizontal Component</h5><p>This includes everybody&#39;s favorite university mandated requirements&#58; the CLEs. The university rightly believes that a good student should not put a sole focus on one subject. Students should not only take classes outside of their major, but they should connect these other classes to their primary focuses. Rikakis also believes in new ways of developing cross-disciplinary action, like his <b>Destination Areas</b>. </p>
                            </li>
                            <li><h5>The Enhanced T</h5>
                            <p>This component is all about making our learning technologically advanced and 21st century. As a university we should be thinking about and using &ldquo;cross-cutting technology&rdquo; and approaching it humanistically &#40;here&#39;s a good <a href="http://liberalarts.vt.edu/about/vt-shaped_learner.html">article</a> on the perspective the College of Liberal Arts takes on the enhanced T and figures like Galileo and DaVinci&#41;.</p>
                            </li>
                        <li><h5>The V Component</h5><p>According to the V component, students should practice the makings of the T component outside of school, through partnerships, internships and other practical uses. </p></li>
                        
                    </ol>
<p> In all, the initiative serves as a template for the university to guide its students and academic programs towards the 21st century. It is also a recruiting tool, to sell the university to students who might be thinking about ending up somewhere else.</p>
                <p> But what does the initiative really do for <strong>real</strong> students like me&#63; Dear reader, go to the <a href="theantivtshapedstudent.html">Anti VT-Shaped Student</a> to find out.</p>
