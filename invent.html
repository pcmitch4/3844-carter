                <h1>Inventing the VT-Shaped Student: Student Counsel</h1>
                <h2>Step One&#58; Learn yourself</h2>
                <p>In order to invent &ldquo;VT-Shaped&rdquo; Students, they need to know what that means whether explicitly or implicitly. For me, I implicitly understood that being &ldquo;VT-Shaped,&rdquo; or being a well rounded student, involved branching beyond primary interests, finding internships or work outside of the universtiy, and being tech saavy. I didn't have a fancy name for it, like &ldquo;VT-Shaped,&rdquo; but the concept makes sense to me now that it has been explicitly drilled in my memory. </p>
                <p>So for students that <em>don&#39;t</em> have those ideas on their own, my project will first need to establish this.</p>
                <h2>Step Two&#58; Acknowledge yourself&#33;</h2>
                <p>So you&#39;re already a VT-Shaped Student&#63; Great&#33; Part of being a rounded individual should be to help others be well-rounded too, so a self-sustaining system can be built. Think <i>Ut prosim</i>&#59; that I may serve. </p>
                <p>By acknowledging your own strengths and weaknesses as a student, you can serve the community. Use your strengths to build others&#39; weaknesses up, and use others&#39; strengths to build on your own weaknesses. There needs to be a platform for this...</p>
                <h2>Step Three&#58; The Platform</h2>
                <p>I propose an online forum, somewhat similar to Reddit.</p>
                    <p>How will it be the same&#63; </p><ul><li>User accounts can be anonymous</li><li>Students can post topics that other students comment on. Comment streams can tangent off of each other.</li><li>The website should be simple&#59; this is a community of information and content superfluous to the main topic should be filtered out.</li></ul> 
                    <p>How will it be different&#63;</p> <ul><li>The point of this community is to share information to build each other as students and career-seekers. Entertainment and social posts are for someplace else.</li><li>&ldquo;Upvoting&rdquo; and &ldquo;downvoting&rdquo; are unnecessary here, as a level community. </li></ul>
                <h2>What does that look like&#63;</h2>
                <p>The ideas of my Student Counsel community are shown in this awesome video&#33;</p>
